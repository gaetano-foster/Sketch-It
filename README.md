# Sketch-It

---

## Overview

Sketch-It is a minimalist sketching application built entirely in Java using native libraries. Designed for simplicity and experimentation, the application provides a basic canvas and toolset for freehand drawing and radial line work using a keyboard-and-mouse interface.

## Features

* Multiple drawing tools: Pencil, Radial, Marker, and Eraser
* Eight built-in color selections
* Radial point placement for creative geometric effects
* Lightweight and easy to run on any platform with Java installed

## Controls

### Tools

* Pencil Tool: Press `1`
* Radial Tool: Press `2`
* Marker Tool: Press `3`
* Eraser Tool: Press `4`

### Colors

* Black: `5`
* Red: `6`
* Green: `7`
* Blue: `8`
* Yellow: `9`
* Purple: `0`
* Cyan: `-`
* Grey: `=`

### Mouse Actions

* Left Click: Draw
* Right Click: Set radial origin point

## Usage

Upon launch, the application presents a blank canvas. Users can toggle between tools and colors using keyboard keys, then draw directly with mouse input. Right-clicking enables radial drawing from a fixed origin.

## Requirements

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* No external dependencies

## Status

This is a functional prototype suitable for educational purposes or as a foundation for more advanced drawing applications.
